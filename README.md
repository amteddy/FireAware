# FireAware
This is a solution for fire management and prediction of wild fire using machine learning/AI techniques and make communities to be aware via different channels. 
The solution idea is to get active wildfire as well as predict future happenings using information from different sources. The source is satellites that gives as active fire information. 
It is meant to continue to also forecast/predict the possible happening of wildfire by using Machine learning. The wild fire occurrence inputs are collected from communities around the are via mobile app or Finnish Meteorology. 
The code in here covers a proto type of the app in which people get a satellite image of the fire coverage that is overlaid by our ML algorithm as well as our algorithm. 
Authorities and community will be informed about the possible recommended actions. The authorities will also communicate to the public using e.g. radio communications in areas where there are no internet connections. 

# Use of Artificial Intelligence
We used AI/Machine Learning to both detect and predict wild fire using machine learning algorithm. The algorithm does the following
    When volunteers/community notifies a new wildfire info via mobile app, the ML algorithm requests satellite coverage and estimate the coverage and impact.
    It also gets other satellite images of data such as weather and forecasts possible wildfire happening
